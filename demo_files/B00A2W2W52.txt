["This dock has a removable insert to supposedly accommodate the added bulk of &#34;some&#34; cases. I tried using this dock with the slimmest of cases (Cygnett Urban Shield, Spigen Slim Armor) and I could not get a connection.  So, if you don't have a case this dock works well out of the gate.  If you do have a case odds are you won't be able to connect for a charge.", 'This one is awesome. Good quality and easy to use. Comes with an adapter for standard iPhone5.You can also clip-out this &#34;frame&#34; if you like to use your iPhone5 with your bumper still mounted.', "I spent over an hour browsing desktop docks for the iPhone 5. I found this item but unfortunately there were no reviews. But I decided to take a chance and get it. It is perfect. With the insert in place, an iPhone 5 without a case fits perfectly. Without the insert, an iPhone with a standard size case fits great. I am sure an Otterbox type case wouldn't fit, but my snap on hard plastic case fits. I just plugged my existing charging cable into the back and it works. The iPhone sits at a nice angle and the connector fits snug. Definitely a great desktop charger and worth every penny. My only gripe is that its only available in black. A white option would be nice.***Update*** After just a few night of charging fine, I woke up to a dead phone. Appears that something is loose inside the dock connector and it no longer charged my phone. I started the return process and the company responded very quickly. I am awaiting a replacement dock. They seem to be very willing to work with me once the stock is replenished. I am hoping I got a defective unit and this isn't the way they all are.***Update II*** Ended up just getting my money back and not using a dock. Company was good with the return.", "Nice dock ... removed one star because I had to take out the tray to allow my phone w/thin case to fit, which it does well. The connector is tight, definitely have to hold on while removing phone, but it does exactly what it's supposed to do. Would like to see it for $10 less.UPDATE -- after a few months of use (after the return period was up) the lightning connector broke away when I was taking the phone out. Reduced to 1 star."]

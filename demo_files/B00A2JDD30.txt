["I ordered two replacement glass back covers, one for each of my daughters and one of them was fine and the other the lens over the camera fell off before as soon as we opened the package. With the cost of shipping it isn't worth sending back. Now I am worried her camera lens is going to get scratced up.", "Looked great,  unfortunately it was harder to get in and wasn't going in easily,  and when I pushed a little hard it cracked.  So I can only say be careful during install.  I ordered another one to try again.", 'ORDERED THE PRODUCT FOR A 4S and the PRODUCT THAT CAME IN WAS FOR A 4!!! ORDERED TWO! ONE FITS THE 4S THE OTHER DOES NOT! HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!', 'it works, but theres thin parts of the plastic so light goes thru it, thats kind of lame but whatever it works, easy replacement with tools']

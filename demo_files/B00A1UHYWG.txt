['So classy and very fashionable. This case adds a little bit of color that the iPhone was lacking. Thanks guys!', 'Looks like the pictures and fits the iPhone 5 great.  Keep in mind, this is mostly a case for looks, not protection.', 'I ordered three of these and unfortunately the green one came damaged. The rest were fine and I absolutely adore the bright colours (pink and purple)...you should let the cases "air out" first because when you open the pack they have a strong chemical/paint scent.I must say that this seller has excellent customer service because I was quickly refunded my 1.99 for the broken case. They were very accommodating and helpful.Would reccomend to anyone who wants a stylish case for their iphone 5.', "I bought this mainly because of Hanna off of Pretty Little Liars. It doesn't have a plastic feel to it, its really smooth and I bought this in purple as well and I love both of the cases. Would totally purchase again."]

["I received a completely different color than what i ordered. I ordered the &#34;dark purple&#34; and received more of a fuchsia color. It still works pretty well: it holds up to 2 credit cards and you might be able to squeeze in another thin card. After one small drop, mine cracked. Overall, i wouldn't recommend.", "This is for my daughter's phone and it works abd fits great!! She is able to carry cards , such as her license and identification in the holder...she has several cases but uses this case solely at this time.  She loves the color and the options it presents, especially when you don't have pockets or don't feel like carrying a purse!!!", 'Great looking case, serve several functions. (Phone case, sm. purse) this case is easy to use. I like it for its versility.', "This is a great case! I've owned 2 of these already. They break if dropped but hey, what a cheap insurance policy to protect your phone!", "this is a very convenient case especially for days I don't want to carry a purse but need my cards and identification, and your cards will be very secure because of the fit and in the fact that I never let my phone out of my sight.", 'Super duper happy when I found this on Amazon. A guest at my hotel had it and I knew I had to get me one. I knew I could count on Amazon to have it. I am very happy with my case. I especially love the price I paid. Shipping was free--even better. I would most definietly buy from this seller again. No complaints.', 'The color is more pinkish than purple and it fits slightly loose on my iphone. The credit card slot thing holds onto my cards without a problem but the phone slides in the case.']

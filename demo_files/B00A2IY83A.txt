Couldn't tell it was replaced just looking at it.", "Easy to swap out and now I don't have broken glass anymore.. looks just like the original and fit the same as the original.. if you have a broken 4s back get this and a cheap set of tools for the retarded Iphone screws and go to town.", "Haven't been able to install it yet because the tool that came with the other piece we bought doesn't fit. Still, I can tell by looking at and holding this piece that it's pretty decent quality."]

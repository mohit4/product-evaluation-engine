['Blue part gets dirty easily!!', "I've seen a lot of people on here complaining about the cheap quality & that it falls apart on them, but I haven't had that issue at all! It's very cute, and I am definitely enjoying it. Love the colors!", "I have this case on my phone right now and LOVE it! It doesn't take much to please me but this case came in good condition. The black piece has a shine to it and got scratches somewhat quickly but that cane happen when you slide your phone onto the desk or slide it to the edge of the counter to pick it up. I read reviews that the black piece cracked or broke while taking it on or off the phone, I have not had that problem.", "So my case arrived today and the black part looks like someone has been using it for weeks. It's scratched up and worn on the corners....like when you keep taking your phone out of your pocket or purse.The colour is great and everything but I paid for a new item not one that looks like it's second hand.Still love the overall idea of be case though....fits my phone snug and everything but I'm really upset that it looks beaten up.Update:I contacted the seller and they gave me a full refund. They responded really quickly and were extremely accommodating and willing to help. So I must give them credit for their excellent customer service."]

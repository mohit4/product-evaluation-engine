['I was looking for something different to my wife and this case its strong and beautiful. Good price and i recommend it.', 'Love it this case is just what I expected and I love the design, it is slim and protects my case more than I thought it would.', 'this is really cute phone case, i like it alot, and it came in when it stated it would too', "Really cute but the heart doesn't really show up if you have the white iPhone 4. 3 piece case & fits like a glove, looks really cute. Shipping took about 2-3 weeks but really enjoy the case. Do recommend.", "This one came in broken  The bottom pice snaps on to the sides and the main backing is a inlay piece. Came in scuffed with paint and the pieces will not click in together. If it was not broken I would like it. Also if it wasn't in three click in pieces"]

['I made a good choice whenI thought of buying this, its very safe, & not to bulky! Overall very satisfied customer.', 'Very satisfied with my purchase. The quality is good and the shipping is quick. The case provides enough friction to enable a good grip on the phone. TPU (the plastic material where the case is made of) virtually resists oil and dust. I used to have an Otter box for my other phone. The protection is excellent BUT the silicone attracts dust like crazy. The S-Style pattern at the back is more of a personal taste - some people like it but some other may not. To me it adds some flavor to an otherwise plain black case. The protection on all 4 sides on the front panel looks sufficient (anyone dare to slam your phone on the floor to test it out?). I wish the top margin (above the earphone) can wrap down by a few mm. Overall I feel my phone secured in the case.', 'totally awesome, It was made with good quality and I would purchase this again in another color it still looks new!', 'this case is better than i thought i love the feel and design and it is well made and doen not collect dust.', 'This product arrived quickly. It fits my HTC and is easy to get on and off, I have no complaints.', 'Great Grip, Great Style, Gerat Durability, Great PRICE! Lasts long. SLIM FIT! Should be included in every HTC sensation purchase and if it was it may have beaten the iPhone 5! Too bad HTC']

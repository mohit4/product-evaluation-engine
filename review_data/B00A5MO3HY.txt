['When I want a fast charge for any of my devices, I\'ll used an AC wall adapter.  I\'ve seen them go up to 15V, but for most of my needs this 10W USB wall dual AC adapter is perfect.  It\'s also one of the more reasonably priced ones I\'ve seen on the market.  The dual ports in this iFlash make it really easy to charge two devices, especially with its compact nature.  There\'s no scrambling to try to find two outlets because my single chargers are too large to go into one.I\'d recommend keeping the iFlash right in the box or finding a small container for it.  Like all of these chargers, the ports are open and vulnerable to getting dust and debris in them.  The compact size of 2" x 2" x 1 1/8" makes it particularly easy to store.  This is definitely a nice little charger that rates right up there with the "big" names.  I tried it out with a couple of my devices, including my iPad and it lives up to its high performance claims.PROS:~  Very compact~  Flip-down AC prongs~  Blue LED light lets you know your charge is in progress~  Short circuit protection~  Overheat protection~  Trickle charge when your device is fully charged~  Compatibility with a wide variety of devices~  High output 5 volts~  Ability to charge two devices at once at onceCONS:~  None I can think ofSPECS:~  Input:  AC 100 - 240V, 50 - 60Hz~  Output:  5 volts, 2.1 amps~  Weight:  2.1 ounces~  Material:  PC material~  LED indication:  Blue~  Safety approval:  CE & FCC & ROHSWARRANTY:~  12 months limitedSample provided for review.', 'With two USB charging ports sharing 2.1 Amps, the iFlash dual port AC travel wall charger can recharge two cellphones simultaneously, or a cellphone and a tablet. Keep in mind, however, that cellphones typically like about 1.0 Amp for quickest charging, and small tablets like around 2.0 Amps, so you could charge two bigger tablets simultaneously with the iFlash charger, but the recharge time would be longer than if you were only charging one device. For most people who charge their devices overnight for 7-8 hours, I doubt if the slower recharging speed would matter. I tested the iFlash overnight with an Android cellphone and a Kindle Fire HD 7" tablet, and both were recharged to 100% (both had been run down to about 20-25% when the test began). There was no overheating of the charger or the two mobile devices.By comparison, the Amazon Kindle PowerFast AC charger has an output of 1.8 Amps, has only one port, and costs considerably more than the iFlash.This is a very compact charger - 2"x2"x1", weighing barely two ounces, and the plugs swing into a recess when not in use. Note that no cables are included, but USB cables come with practically every mobile device sold nowadays. Either as a primary AC charger or as a backup charger, the iFlash is a good choice for recharging your mobile phones and tablets.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.', "The iFlash Dual Port USB 2.1 A Wall Charger works quite well as a travel charger because of the small size and folding prongs. It is also ideal for routine use because it doesn't block the other socket in the wall outlet.It is very compact at about 2&#34; x 2&#34; x 1&#34;. It has a very bright blue LED to indicate that it has power and to serve as a nightlight in a strange hotel room or bathroom. The prongs are easy to flip in and out and fit securely in the socket.Both ports can be used simultaneously but they are positioned very close together. I do have a couple of USB cables with large heads that are a tight fit but are not a problem when paired with a standard cable. The ports provide 2.1 A of power. It works perfectly with my Kindle Paperwhite and iPod shuffle.A sample was provided for testing and unbiased review.", 'This was a great by. In less than 1/2 the regular time my ipad was charged.  Just as the name says &#34;flash&#34;  it charges really fast and in a flash.  I am impressed.  Great product!  Worth the money.  I would not hesitate to buy again.']

["I purchased a phone case that was a similar style and this one didn't let me down either. Great purchase for the price.", "Works great for the price. It isn't as robust as an otterbox case but it isn't as bulky or expensive either.", "I bought this for myself. I have  about 43 cases (don't judge :P) and i have to say this is by far one of my favorite ones now. It is a really brighter and cuter pink in person. I love the little stand so we can watch movies, YouTube, record....etc. It was really fast shipping. And some companies may provide tracking information, which i love. It is also really protective because it covers the front really good. The only i didn't like is that at first it smelt really bad. But now it doesnt", "Perfect for granddaughter, she was soooo happy with this.  Fits exactly as anticipated .  Loves the color and the stand in back. Get one, you won't be disappointed."]

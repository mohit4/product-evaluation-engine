['Other power cases muffled the speaker sound. This one had a great sound port on the back for clear listening.', "Wow!  What a cute battery case! I saw a Christian sister with one of these on her phone!  That gave ne an idea-I decided to order me and my sister a battery case-mine is white, (since my phone is white), and my sister's is black,(since her phone is blue).Anyway, these little guys give you power for your phone! If we run out juice, especially when on the go, we can just connect this case to our phone, and it is POWER ON THE GO!! (I'm just concerned about the functionality).", "Great case. Doubled my battery life like promised. Can't beat the price. I would recommend it for a friend. A+", 'Great case, sturdy, doubles battery, wont have to worry any more. I purchased this for my kid and he is very HAPPY.', "Bought one for me and the wife (diff color;phone, not  wife, lol.). Firefighter work 24 hr shift and never know when if will get to recharge so this is perfect for me and anyone else that can't always plug in to charge each day.", 'I used to be obsessed with changing phone cases, but now I am obsessed with THIS phone case!! What a great find !! 5 STARS']

['Excellent suction cup and perfect fit unless I use the extended battery.  I wish it comes with a power port built in so I do not have to do too many plug and unplug and just dock the phone and go.', 'The plate that holds the phone is solid. The base broke way to quick. Since the mounting system is standard I was able to replace just the base and keep going.', "This Car mount does a good job, in detail:Comes with a wristband and also has a cloth that comes with to clean your phone i guess; however i used it for my glasses.The mount itself is sturdy and durable i tested it through a serie of bumps and rail road tracks and purposely making it move, but further ado it stayed in place. My problem is that it seems to vibrate and there is no shock absorbent, i worry that it might damage it internally as i cant have case around it either while using the mount. That could be a factor as the car i drive might be the issue but i will further test this out and update my review. For the money its not too bad but i do have in mind another mount by kidigi that is more money but has supreme quality but isn't available to buy in the US, only over seas.PROS: Durable, Easy access to ports, Sturdy, 360* joints for different placement and viewing angle preferences, Suction Super Cup, Tight fit to grip the phone properly.CONS: Wont work with a case, No shock absorbent.", 'Very good quality, fits phone perfectly. Please note that the phone will NOT fit into this mount with any type of case. Suction is good against windshield, and buttons, camera, etc are all accessible while in the mount. No issues.']

['listed for a 5 got a 4... had to give it to my friend but she loved it! luckily it was cheap', 'I originally bought this for me but then I gave it to my mom. The only bad thing is the rhinestone fall out easy. In one week, I was missing one already.', 'My roommate and I both have iPhones and love putting on different covers. I bought this one for her because she loves light blue and glitter. We both like it. My only complaint is it is just for looks. It adds no protection to your phone.', "I ordered this because of the color and received it 2 days ago, the color was exactly what I had in mind but two of the stones were missing and I'm planning to replace them myself but it's gonna be hard because I don't have the tool and it is a very small stone.  Overall it was nice.", 'I LOVED MY PHONE COVER , THIS ONE WAS FOR ME. IT WAS VERY BLINGY AND SHINY WIHICH I LOVE. VERY LIGHTWEIGHT AND EASY TO PUT ON AND TAKE OFF.', "This case is beautiful! It looks great on my black Iphone. The glitter comes off a little bit on your hand, but that was to be expected. Any glitter product would do that. It's very shimmery in the light. I'm in bling heaven! haha", 'My granddaughter loved the case until it lost some of its stones. She now has another one I bought her and she loves it.']

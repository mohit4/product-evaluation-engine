I personally prefer 1 piece cases so this just wasn't what I wanted.", 'very simple but love compare to the other cases I have ordered , but love the Love on the back of the case.', 'It does protect the phone, its a two piece case. It exactly as the picture, easy to put on but I had soo much trouble trying to take it off. I was scared to break the case while trying to take it off. Would of given it 5 starts but that was just a problem for me.', "Was too small for my phone, wouldn't snap on! Waste of money. Bad choice. One, two, three, four, five, six."]

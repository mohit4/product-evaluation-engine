['I really like the protection that this case offers, but it makes the phone quite bulky.  If you&#8217;re not concerned with adding extra size and weight to your phone, this is ideal.', "Protects the iPhone very well with it's combination of hard and rubberized shell.  Really like the button covers.  Love the color combination as well.", "I bought this case for my iPhone not long after getting it. It provides more than enough protection from everyday use. But I found it to be too bulky. I ended up giving the case to someone else and going ceaseless with my iPhone. Had it for about a year now and have never dropped it.The biggest issue I had was also the biggest draw of this case. The rubber grips were nice when you held the phone in your hands, but trying to take it in and out of your pocket proved difficult. The grip would stick to the inside of my pocket and would catch when I tried to take the phone out, almost causing me to drop it. In my mind that's counterproductive, a case that increases the chance of dropping your phone during everyday use.This case looks good and protects well, but it has too many flaws for my tastes.", 'I purchased this for my son and we assummed it was for an ipod-it was for an iphone. It is still a great product and very fast delivery. Great customer service, I ended up sending it back and got full credit immediately! Awesome company. Going to purchase the ipod case for the ipod 5 from them!']

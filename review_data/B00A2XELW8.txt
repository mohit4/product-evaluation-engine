['I loved the color, the case was cute just was not what I wanted for my phone. The case was in new condition and I recieved my case way ahead of the estimated date. Would I reccommend this company to anyone.... NO, I really don\'t think that as a customer... they we would buy something for one price with including the the cost for the seller to charge us "the customers" to dish out to them for the customers to recieve the product. If for whatever the reason the customer was unhappy to have to spend yet again their money to ship the seller back their product for a refund to get stiff in the end. My refund was way less than what I originally paid for the product. Doesn\'t make sense. I won\'t purchase anything else....that\'s for sure!!', "Love the color it's a little slippery but it's a good fix look good on just hold on to your phone a little tighter", 'this was an amazing fit! I loved how soft it was and when I peeled it off my phone it was still good lil dirty but good', 'This is a nice and pretty cas I like it a lot..planning to buy more colors and the price  was a good deal', "I like the fact that this case doesn't give the added bulk that my otter box gives however, I don't like the fact that it is a two piece product. I wanted something durable that was one piece.", 'came with a very small chip on it.  easy to assemble together and take apart.  not too heavy either. I thought it was going to be soft rubber though?', 'this is the best phone (so far) that i have had the pleasure of owning,hopefully i wont be writing this again in two years!the intuitve actions of the phone still amaze me,+comfortability is wonderful,the only drawback is the time it is taking to get relaxed with it.']

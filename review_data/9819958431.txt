['The raised edges protect the screens from falls. The battery case looks stylish and charges me up. This case is fannnnntastic', 'fits well on the phone and it is easy to use. the price is unbeatable and the product works like advertised', 'The S5 is a fantastic phone. However because of its large screen the phone dies quickly. With the extended battery I am able to enjoy all of the phones features without losing power. Great buy.', 'Totally worth the money, It protects my phone in even of the most dangerous situations where I dropped my phone and it also keeps my battery going for Days. BRAVO!', "I got this case for my nephew, and he claims that it was not what he expected. He has a charge case for his last phone, and it covered the whole thing. This is just like a back of the phone replacement, so it doesn't add to much weight", 'This is a really great case, looks and feels amazing, not to mention that the battery lasts for many hours.', "I think this case is an excellent choice, since it is not so bulky, the color is nice, the texture on the back is good for gripping, and it extends battery life. It's a life saver, and there isn't too much on the market at the time for this phone so I am happy with it. Bought both blue and black for me and my brother right after we got home from the phone store. Would recommend."]

["I bought this case for my son's iPod touch but he didn't like it.  He said it felt cheaply made compared to other similar cases he bought.", 'I purchased one for me and one for a friend.  She loves it.  She had already dropped her ipod and this is much more secure and sturdy case.', "Great case but I received the wrong color and my adapter for the charger for the 4th gen doesn't fit with the case on. Otherwise great sturdy case.", 'Good product has been working great.', 'Works well with my Ipod. sturdy and easy to put on. have dropped the ipod and this case has protected it.', "Just as good as the full protection cases and for a lot cheaper. Love the colors and the kickstand. The only con is that it doesn't have a screen protector attached.", 'Nice color. Perfect fit for my apple Ipod gen5. I especially like the ability to stand freely. This is an alternate case, to use if the main breaks or becomes soiled.', "I bought this for my daughter's iPod and it works great.  She is known for dropping things, so this is protecting it quite well.  We both like it.", 'This product is fun! I got it for my son and he loves it! This is a great product and it is a great price!

["I like this case. This is the second one I've bought. They protect my s3 amazingly well, and that's great because I'm pretty clumsy. But the piece right above the volume button is thin and cracks very fast. Then it hooks onto things and soon becomes a bother. But for protection, absolutely great. The phone, front and back, are covered. Easy to release phone from holster also. Feels comfortable in your hands.", 'This item clicks on the belt and is firmly attached and does not slip out easily which is a good thing. If there was a beef about this product it is when you turn the clip sideways the thumb part of the clip when worn tends to poke you in the side when you are sitting. I think they should cut down the thumb clip, otherwise, I am really happy with it.', 'I am not as hard on phones as some people so I did not need an armored case to protect my phone. This shell and holster combo is exactly what I need and at a great price!', "Pros:  This is a pretty good case for the money.  It is way cheaper than buying one at Best Buy or the like.  Something like this would run you like 60 bucks in a retail store so it is a good value.  The case itself is pretty solid but there is no screen protection which isn't a big deal for me.  Overall it doesn't add too much bulk to an already big phone.Cons:  The stand on mine is very difficult to pop out without a little prying help.  I have a feeling that the belt clip will eventually break off but they always do, even on expensive cases.  It is uncomfortable to carry the case with the phone mounted vertically.  I will say in one instance my phone fell out of the case when it was mounted horizontally but it is possible I put it in wrong.Impression:  Good case for the money."]

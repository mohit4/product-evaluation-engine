["This product arrived when promised and in the condition promised. It is a genuine Blackberry charger. It was brand new and worked perfectly. For the price, I don't think you can ask for much more than that!", 'Great product. Use this with my Galaxy S4. At this price I bought 2 more. One for work and one to keep in the car incase I ever travel and forget my charger.', "Honestly I have always loved this specific model, since you can just take it with you on the road not worrying if you end up losing it or leaving it where ever you go. Though it doesn't exactly meet the fast charging needs of high end phones, it works pretty well on all of them, you just need to be patient.", "I've had this charger well over a year now, and it still works perfectly.  Most chargers would have broken by now.  The folding blades make this more portable than the chargers that come with some Blackberry models that have adapters for different countries."]

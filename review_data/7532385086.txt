['The idea of the design is a sweet idea but it wears off as the paint is over the case and not under a sealant or anything. It has a cool 3D effect but at the cost of the paint rubbing off.It is quite pretty though.', 'I was worried about this order because the picture on the description page kept changing to a less-desireable green/orange cover.  But alas, it came a day earlier than expected, and the beautiful pink product expected!  The "rubberized" cover feels a little greasy (like it was armor-all\'d), but the design is gorgeous and a little 3D looking!', 'Another pretty phone case that I really love. I have many as I love t o change them around .thanks', "The case is not white, its more of a silver. It's still a very pretty case- it fit my phone perfectly. It took too long to arrive.", "Defintiely worth the price...You should order several.  Most cases are $15 and up especially at the cell phone stores.  I can't believe the mark up on these things!", 'This is a great case... It fit my phone perfectly and I still use it from time to time. Would recommend', 'Received this item very quickly. The design is even more vivid than expected. The cover is soft (rubberized) but durable. I have received many compliments. It was an excellent buy! I would recommend this to anyone wanting a "good look" for their phone.', 'this cover makes an old phone look and feel new. I like that I can order covers for little money and snazzy up my phone.']

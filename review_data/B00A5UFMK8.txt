["This is a universal car mount that is better designed for smaller phones. I have the HTC DNA, and snapping the phone into place requires some force in one direction, so the mount swivels as you're pushing in. Not practical in my opinion.", 'Good snug fit. Like that it includes dash and window mount capability. Excellent for hands free use in states requiring it.', 'Excellent profit. Fits all phones and very secure. I would buy this item again. Holds tight on dash board. Quick delivery.', 'Product seems like it will work for my LG G2, will be using in my car that has no extra room to put anything.', "It's an okay product.  Barely fits my LG G2 w/ an ultra slim case.  Essentially, I have to unmount it from my windshield each time.  Glad the G2 has rear keys, as sliding a GS4 in is more difficult.  For around $15, you can find a better design for your specific device.  Instead of the top folding over your phone, this is spring loaded and you'll wish you had three hands.", 'I use an iBolt device in my truck but needed something lighter for use in car. This was it. Holds almost any phone. Good adjustability. What more needs to be said?', "Grips very well, Don't use for anything over 5''  fits my HTC DNA  barely ,  likes smaller phones better such as EVO , Bionic  4.3&#34; types.", 'Bought a few different dashboard/windshield cradles. This is the only one that holds my phone in place and also allows me to run my dashcam app with an unobstructed view. Very easy to set up (I attached to windshield), holds firmly, and does the job.', "it's a very very good product I would recommend anybody needs a product like this. For your cell phone awesome in the car."]

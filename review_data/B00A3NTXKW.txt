Other than that its nice and I like it", 'Got this case because I thought it would be cool to have and also its actually really easy to carry my phone now!! :) Came in about a week because it ships from China or something so be prepared to wait a week for it! Overall great product. I have dropped my phone with the case on it and nothing happened to my phone nor the case! BUY IT!', 'stylish, sleek, fashion forward and soo pop culture. luv it, its an attention grabber and also is very sturdy and could be used as a brass knuckle if need be..lol !~!', 'This is just a cheap plastic case. Super bulky. But still a cool novelty to use every now and then.', "Cheap looking and hard to put on and take off. Not worth the headache or wait. Don't buy it, and you can't get into the club with it, they think it's a weapon. But it's only PLASTIC ... CHEAP ASS PLASTIC"]

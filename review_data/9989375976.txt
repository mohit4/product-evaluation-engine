Nice retractable cord. It retracts at the push of a button.', 'it was the wrong one.The male end does not fit the Iphone 4s .  Once it was pulled out it would not retract', 'I have not used this as of yet , however, my wife has without issue.I have the x50 headset and she has the voyage, it works on both really well.', 'THIS IS A BAD CHARGER IT DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY AND IT HAS A REALLY BAD SHORTAGE. I HATE IT!', 'works great for powering my Plantronics BT. i like the retractable cord so it doesnt have a long cord getting in the way. nice and compact and easy to store when not in use']
